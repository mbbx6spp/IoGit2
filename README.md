# IoGit2 #

Io bindings for the libgit2 library. Simply because Io rocks and who wouldn't
want to maintain, administer and integrate with Git using Io?

## Installation ##

First clone, build and install libgit2 (must have CMake already installed):

    $ git clone git://github.com/libgit2/libgit2.git
    $ cd libgit2
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ make install

Now clone me (IoGit2). Yes, a Git repository is talking to you. Deal!

    $ git clone git://github.com/mbbx6spp/IoGit2.git

## Howto ##

Coming as soon as I have a working release of me.
